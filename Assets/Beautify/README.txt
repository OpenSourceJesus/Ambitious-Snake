How to use this asset
---------------------
We recommend importing the asset in an empty project and run the Demo Scenes provided to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Read the documentation and experiment with the tool.

Later, you can import the asset into your project excluding the demo folder.

Important: in Unity 5.4, the Game View has a scale slider. The demo scenes print some info texts on top of screen. If you don't see the texts, choose "Free Aspect" and/or reduce scale to show entire screen.

Hint: to use the asset, select your camera and add "Beautify" script to it.



Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains additional instructions and description about the asset, as well as some recommendations.



Support
-------
Please read the documentation PDF and browse/play with the demo scene and sample source code included before contacting us for support :-)

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Beautify will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
